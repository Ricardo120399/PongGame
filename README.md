# PongGame
I made a couple of changes to this branch: Instead of repeating the same code in order to make balls move, I just create a list an write a for each loop to make every ball to do the same, due to the high speed of the ball I changed from 0 to 8 however It keep fast...
The issue with it that the balls move so fast this is why I imported time library and use time.spleed function but is comment because if I use balls move really really slow then it become worst than before.
Also I re-write the AI funcionality: instead of calling just one I create a variable call "closest_ball" to save a list call ball an then i wrote a for each to let the code know when any ball is close to the Independent paddle, which is the right one.
